Building
~~~~~~~~
  1. cd into "1-reader"
  
  2. Build the project with "make DIS_SRC=/path/to/DIS/src", or modify the path in the Makefile.
  
  3. Repeat 1. and 2. for "2-encoder" and "3-writer"


Running
~~~~~~~
  1. The reader can be started with "make read" and has the following optional arguments:
        LOCAL_ADAPTER_NO - The local adapter number (defaults to 0)
        NODE_ID_ENCODER  - The SISCI node ID of the encoder (defaults to 28)
        VIDEO            - One of the following integrals: (defaults to 0)
                              0 - foreman.yuv
                              1 - foreman_4k.yuv
                              2 - tractor.yuv
                              3 - bagadus.yuv

  2. The encoder can be started with "make encode" and has the following optional arguments:
        LOCAL_ADAPTER_NO - The local adapter number (defaults to 0)
        NODE_ID_READER   - The SISCI node ID of the reader (defaults to 4)
        NODE_ID_WRITER   - The SISCI node ID of the writer (defaults to 8)
  
  3. The writer can be started with "make write" and has the following optional arguments:
        LOCAL_ADAPTER_NO - The local adapter number (defaults to 0)
        NODE_ID_ENCODER  - The SISCI node ID of the encoder (defaults to 28)

  4. The writer stores the encoded file in the temp directory
